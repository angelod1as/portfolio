I love instruments with **keys**, like the **piano** (even though I'm not a piano player).

I tried to learn the **trumpet** and the **accordion**. I had lots of fun, but failed.

In a distant past, I played the **melodica** and the **glockenspiel** on a band. We even have a disc on Spotify (but no one shalll know that, I hope).

Since then I've dabbled in **Ableton Live** and music made by computers. All the songs presented here were made using it and **Ableton Push 2**.

My current musical dream is to have [Marc Rebillet](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcRebillet)'s gear.
