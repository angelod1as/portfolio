I'm no longer a full-time designer, even though I still **love** the theme and see myself working with design again.

My designer career grew mostly on **print** design, specially **newspapers**.

I'm crazy about **Adobe InDesign**, good enough in **Adobe Illustrator**, not so bad in **Adobe Photoshop**. If needed, I even dabble in **Adobe After Effects**.

Lately, **Figma** has been my everyday friend and love.
