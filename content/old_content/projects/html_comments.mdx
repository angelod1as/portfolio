This was my first ever NPM Package and Gatsby plugin, so I thought it would be nice to showcase it here. Here's it's readme:

# HTML Comments

When trying to add HTML comments to Gatsby, they get removed or encoded as string.

This plugin adds comments after Gatsby's build process finishes, replacing specificied custom categories with whatever code the user needs.

_This was created after the need to insert SSI comments inside Gatsby_

## How to install

`yarn add gatsby-plugin-html-comments` or `npm install gatsby-plugin-html-comments`

## Usage:

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file, preferably at the last, after (almost) every other plugin.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-html-comments`,
    options: {
      files: ['./public/**/*.html', './public/*.html'],
      comment: [
        {
          regexp: /<custom-tag>(.*?)<\/custom-tag>/g,
          comment: `<!--comment-->`,
          },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Options:

- **files**: Array of filepaths. The replacer will look on each of these and replace the custom tag with the comment.
- **comment**: Array of objects.
  - **regexp**: Regular expression with a chosen custom tag. Important: always lowercase and hyphen separated to avoid issues.
  - **comment**: The comment or code you want to insert in the final file.

You can add as many objects as you see fit, depending on how many substitutions you need to make.

## Example:

### Without the plugin:

Original code:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <!-- keep this comment! -->
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
)
```

Result: or the comment gets fuzzy...

```html
<div>
  %3C%21--%20keep%20this%20comment%21%20--%3E
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

or the comment gets removed entirely.

### With the plugin:

Config in `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-html-comments`,
    options: {
      files: ['./public/**/*.html', './public/*.html'],
      comment: [
        {
          regexp: /<keep-this-comment-tag>(.*?)<\/keep-this-comment-tag>/g,
          comment: `<!-- keep this comment -->`,
          },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Original code:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <keep-this-comment-tag>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
)
```

Result:

```html
<div>
  <!-- keep this comment -->
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```
