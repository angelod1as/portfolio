One of the simplest projects I made for Folha de S.Paulo, _Cabe√ßa nas nuvens_ (in english, _Head in the clouds_) is the result of the partnership between me and the photographer Diego Padgurschi. He took pictures of the sky to measure the FVC (Sky Vision Factor, a number that translates how much sky a certain part of the city has, used in ecology and geography).

I designed and programmed the resulting product, a simple but appealing way to understand the FVC. When the user clicks at the picture, it changes to the full image (without the mask) and show where it was taken.
