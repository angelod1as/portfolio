Made in 2014, after waking up from nightmares. I had played a session of brazilian RPG "Abismo Infinito" (in english, Infinite Abyss, hence the name) the night before and the cosmic horror setting got me really deep.

The song narrates the journey of a space traveller that, after waking up, suffers from the impact of cryosleep and has allucinations.

## Lyrics

    Waking up
    after twenty years of space travel
    it's not easy, it's not easy at all
    you can't feel your limbs
    you can't feel your mind in place
    everything seems wrong right now

    Waking up
    is not exactly waking
    you keep dreaming, you keep walking around
    you're afraid of every little shadow
    every blink, every sound

    You got things to do,
    and nothing has taken you away from Earth
    There's unfinished business, lost loves and memories
    you need to come back

    But it's hard to stay awake
    you never know when you're dreaming or not
    because every place or time
    you close your eyes
    everything looks wrong

    Earth is a memory, a concept,
    something from the past
    I can't remember the face
    of people I left back there

    I'm confused, sleep and tired,
    reality is not rational
    desperation, halucination, sleep deprivation,
    I'm delusional

    In this infinite abyss
    everything is dark
    even the brightest of stars
    I think I saw a ghost
    I'm losing my mind!

    I'm the only one awake but
    I'm hearing voices, sounds, footsteps
    I'm sending this cry for help
    S.O.S! The pilot is dead.
