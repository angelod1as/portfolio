Angelo is a morning person â€” opposed to his mostly nocturnal peers. That didn't stop him working in different time schedules: he fondly (but not so much) remembers the 'until 2am' schedule while working at Folha de S.Paulo newspaper.

He has some standard 'likes' as a 30 something person, like videogames, graphic novels and partying. He just lives all that kinda *intensely*, so if you ask him about it, he'll talk for hours and hours.

This website is meant to be his 'all I do' place but, as he's always so freaking busy, it's probably outdated and lacking a few words.
