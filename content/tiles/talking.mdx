Talking in front of people (or cameras) was **always** a part of my life and I hone this skill whenever I can.

I used to **teach English**, at 18, to people from 12 to 60 (yes) years old. At college, I loved to do **presentations** and **videos**.

According to Lucas Dias, lawyer, businessman and _my brother_:

> Angelo talks too much.

He's dead right. I always dreamed about reaching people and making using my voice and way-to-excited gestures.

One of the reasons I've been the of many projects is my ease to deal with cameras and crowds. I gave niche-specific talks (like NaNoWriMo pep talk), short reporting for Folha de S.Paulo and I am planning a course about non-conventional narratives.

I can talk in **English** and **Portuguese**, standing or seated, always energetic and compromised in making people understand my topics and feel interested.

## I'd love to

- Make videos
- Do presentations and lectures
- Do hands-on workshops
- Teach, like, anything I know
