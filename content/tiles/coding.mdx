I build stuff using **Typescript**, **NextJS** and **Tailwind**

I can work with **Redux**, **Gatsby**, **React Native** and more.

Even though I'm mainly a Front-end Developer, I can work with some Back-end as well, using **NodeJS**, **GraphQL**, **MongoDB** and **Postgres**.

I want to learn new stuff, like **Python** and **Ruby on Rails** .
