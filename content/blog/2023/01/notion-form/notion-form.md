[Notion](#) is hard to describe. The tool manages notes, TODOs, tables, images, and a plethora of content that can help organise our lives â€” or make it completely chaotic if we fall into the "let me just create _another_ Notion dashboard" black-hole.

This tutorial focuses on showing how to build something simple and straightforward in Notion: a database. We will use the Notion API and any form that can submit a POST request.

To make this even better, it will show you how to do it in vanilla JS, NextJS, and Remix, so you can pick your poison and just start building.

There will be a simple anti-bot solution as well, implemented with the least ammount of code possible.
