# Iteration as **mantra**

## Disclaimer

First of all: this is not a technical story. It looks technical, reads technical and even _smells technical_.

I ask you to believe me: read through it. It will make sense in the end, even for the most lay people.

This is something I needed to say before starting.

## A little context

I fell in love when I started learning about the Agile way of thinking. Sadly, it wasn't where I wanted to learn about it.

I did 2 years of a Project Management postgraduation. I didn't finish it, as I needed to do a final work on traditional project management and, oh boy, I hate it.

### Tradition Project Management

For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about: **Traditional Project Management** (TPM) is simply planning things from start to finish in detail.

<Parenthesis about="An impromptu language irony">

It was not my intention that the abbreviation of Traditional Project Management is TPM, which means Pre-Menstrual Crisis (PMS) in my native language, Brazilian Portuguese.

</Parenthesis>

As an example, we are going to build a house. Let's plan every single detail based on a few TPM principles:

- what will be done;
- when it will start being done;
- who will do it;
- how much time will it take;
- what are the risks involved.

So, we break down tasks into smaller tasks and start planning:

- We need to build the house's foundation;
- It will be started tomorrow;
- It will be done by three builders;
- It will take 2 weeks;
- It might rain, which will wet the concrete and delay the job for at least two days.

Apart from my obvious **zero** knowledge on how to build a house (or what a foundation is), it's possible to see the problem with TPM when we add stuff to the list.

- Foundation
- Starts tomorrow (01/01)
- Done by three builders
- Finishes 2 weeks later (14/01)
- May be delayed if it rains (3 days)
- Concrete floor
  - Starts 1 day after Foundation finishes (15/01)
  - Done by three builders
  - Finishes in 2 days (17/01)
  - May be delayed if it rains (3 days)
- Walls
  - Starts 3 days after Concrete floor is finished (18/01)
  - Done by three builders
  - Finishes in 7 days (25/01)
  - May be delayed if it rains (3 days)

So far we've got a nice planning that can take 25 five days if rain does not touch the project, up to 34 days if it rains once in each step.

But:

What happens if it rains every. single. day?

That's a bummer, of course, but that should be planned as well. Also, we're planning three builders in each step, but "OMG builder number 2 had an issue and won't come to Step 1", so all the steps have to be recalculated after that.

That's why TPM is popularly known as the **Waterfall** method: if something changes, the **whole project changes** from that moment on.

#### Against my beliefs, TPM works

I really dont like the Waterfall method, but it works on some industries, specially on (ironically, because of my examples) the construction industry.

That's why construction firms have dedicated (and very well paid) risk managers to account for all possible issues and changes mid-project and mitigate them.

This is the technical word for it: mitigation. Risk managers don't avoid risk, they know _shit happens_, so they work the hardest to make it _smell less_.

TPM absolutely doesn't work in my industry, technology. While the risks of a TPM project are usually external, most of the risks that involve tech projects are internal: the customer changed his mind.

#### Let's do it all over again

One of the most hated phrases a developer can hear from a project manager is:

> The requirements have changed.

_Holy Ada Lovelace that codes in heaven_, this means basically that we were building a house... and now it needs to behave as an ice-cream store.

> The market has changed. Users don't need houses anymore, but they need ice-cream, and an ice-cream store has everything we have so far, right? Walls, floor, foundation... easy to change!

After 6 months on a project a lot can change, and they **will change**, specifically in a fast market like technology. While you are reading this, someone is inventing the next thing that will change everything for the next months.

Waterfall projects can't handle these kinds of changes in a cost and time-efficient way. Sometimes you have to plan **everything from scratch**.

And then there was Agile.

### The Agile Manifesto

If you work close to tech and don't know the Agile Manifesto, _you should_. It's a really [shitty website coded ages ago](https://agilemanifesto.org/) with this simple, poem-like, manifesto:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
