As this website is still very personal, I know that only close friends signed up to get updates (you can do it too, subscribe at the end of this article).

I say this because I'd love to tell you this on person, but I can't. Is a rather important topic, and I didn't think of a better way to announce this to you all other than writing here for you all to read at the same time.

I'm truly sorry to tell you I've been diagnosed with something awful.

It's happening since I got to Munich, Germany, for work. I felt it growing inside me in a weird way. It started to hurt a little, but always being a bearable pain. The worse part is not the thing itself, but all the implications of it in my life.

Because after you get it, it's forever. There's no cure. There's only learning to live with it and making my life as confortable as possible with it.

I'm sad to announce: I've contracted patriotism.

## Clarifying definitions

According to Merriam-Webster dictionay:

> **Patriotism**: love for or devotion to one's country

### Nationalism

This concept is tied to the political idea of Nationalism, a belief that one nation is superior to other nations. "Nation", by itself, is a complicated term with multiple meanings. For some scholars, a nation can be defined by agreed borders that came to reality after political debate and, most of the times, war, while for others, a nation has no border other than the reach of their people.

Most of our borders, the ones we see on maps, not in real life, were defined by these people in high places and were drawn with blood. Brazilians and others originated in colonized countries know that their entire nation is built upon the graveyard of many, mostly indigenous people, originated way before the white men came with their lust and death.

When you are born inside political borders, you are issued a nation. From that moment on, independently if you move countries, continents, planets, you will always be defined as a part of that nation, that strip of land someone decided to call Brazil, France or Yugoslavia. There are some that even go beyond that notion, like the Jew, believing that anyone born from Jew ascendence is a rightful citizen of their country.

That's definitely not what I'm talking about when I say "patriotism".

### People's nation

I believe a nation is born with its people.

Let's take South Africa as an example. The country has not only been defined by external hands but, inside its own borders, got its people separated by the color of their skin in a horrendous policy. Not only that, but inside the country lives people that were there before the colonizers came, each own with its language and customs. The South African nation is a known lie between their residents, but the same that criticize also don't hesitate to call themselves South African. Their origin is sacred and important.

Another example are the Tartars, a group of people originated in Russia — a continental country that is a great example by itself how stupid borders are. I've met a person that is a Tartar descendant. When we met, she simplified saying she was from Russia, but as soon as the tension was getting softer, she told us of her Tartar origin and some of their traditions. In her words:

> I'm not Russian, I'm Tartar. Russia is just the country I came from, but they are not my people.

She told us about how grandparents warned their kids not to marry Russian people. They said:

> A Russian husband will baptize your kids with Russian names, they will not learn our language and they will not practice our customs. You will be treated like a Russian and, in no time, you will become a Russian.

According to my interpretation, for them, a person is of their nation when they speak the language and pass to your children your nations culture. It's not pure politics that define where you are from, but culture. "You will become a Russian" is a strong phrase for someone that learnt, for their entire life, that Russians erased their identity, their land and their independence as a nation.

I started to think, then, what made me so afraid of saying with loud voice that I come from Brazil, a country which I love and miss?

If you are reading this and you are Brazilian, I think you have an idea.

<Parenthesis about="India and Brazil">

One of the most interesting things I've been learning while meeting some people in Munich is how Brazil has some really amazing comparisons to India.

Both were colonized by a superpower in their times. The colonizer language was imposed, as well as their culture — in our case, religion was more important for the Portuguese than for the English in India. Of course, Indias colonization and Brazil's are very different, historically speaking, but ended up with weird similarities.

I've learnt, for instance, that Indians (not Hindus as a religious nation, but the people born in India) have a very common career possibility: studying like hell to land a shitty government job that has stability. Looks like our country, right?

Another similarity we've talked about is how our food is important to our culture. Indians and Brazilians have a deep love for their home cuisine and will not put their spices down. Food, for us, is not only survival, but love. Food is part of our religious ceremonies and the main way to make our partners and family happy.

This parenthesis is here just to highlight some of my cultural learnings from this brief experience in Germany.
