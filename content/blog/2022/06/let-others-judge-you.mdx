# Let **others** judge you

The only line of this whole article you need to read is this one, although it goes against much of what other people tell me everyday:

> Let others, not you, judge how capable you are of doing something.

I'll explain.

## First: friends know better

I'd love to say this was smooth and natural, but **it wasn't**. There was a specific point in time in which I decided to change **the way I saw my work**. It was a mix of **_fake it till you make it_** and **_shoot the imposter down_**, a conscient action of looking at my professional journey and giving more to it than what I imagined it was worth.

Some could say this is lying, or even embelishing my CV, but I disagree completely (more on lying later). It's more about a **shift of responsability** than anything else.

I was trying to do freelance work and, well, I **suck** at it. I don't know exactly how to get new clients, how to keep them, how to **charge enough** money to pay my bills but not too much so they'll run away.

Being for five years in a regular 9-to-5 (or, many times, 5-to-midnight) made me **improve other characteristics** than having to market myself and my job. I was already employed, all I needed to do was actually **work**, not sell what I did everyday to different people.

So, while freelancing, I saw the necessity to go back to the regular market. The **imposter syndrome**, everlasting and overwhelming, made me think a thousand times that I'd never see the happy face of a fixed monthly income in my life, so **I asked for help**.

This became the whole subject of **weekly therapy sessions**, and I'm very happy that my therapist didn't give me a ready answer. She made me think a lot about **what I was searching**, where I wanted to go and, specially, **who I am** (which is the point of therapy after all). Then, in one sunny afternoon (maybe not sunny neither afternoon, but bear with me), I decided to try something new. I decided to advertise myself as how my peers **said** I was instead of what **I thought** I was.

## Feeback is a **massive** weapon

I started asking my old coworkers what strenghts and weaknesses I had. I asked for honest feedback, crushing truths, and asked them from people I trust. They said a good amount of things for me to get better at but, mostly, they said good things. "They are obviously being dishonest", I thought to myself. It's **impossible** I have all those strenghts and so little ammount of flaws.

But, as the point of the exercise **was judging myself less** and letting others do it, I continued. If you, like me, aren't used to getting compliments, you might understand the **pain** of doing this and getting praise from people. If I'm sounding a little prepotent to you, I **propose a challenge**. Stop reading, get your phone and ask your three **most trusted coworkers** for honest, straight and direct feedback. Ask them to tell you your strenghts and weaknesses, and be prepared to understand better what I'm talking about. People will probably praise you more than highlight your issues. If they actually get to the bad parts, it's highly probable they'll not only say you're shit, but tell you **how to improve**. The map is there, we just never asked for it.

I decided to act like if everything my colleagues said was true. I refactore my resumé, highlighted the strengths and removed the flaws. So, if people said I was good at communication, even though **I think** I'm a lousy journalist and petty writer? Great, let's put that feature, the one **people talked about**, way above the others. They think I'm a good coder, with quality, readable code, and great with multidisciplinary teams? Let's put **that** on spot two and three of the list. The list of things I thought were valuable, but that no one even mentioned, were **lowered in priority** or even scrapped.

<Parenthesis about="removing the flaws">

I've been in enough interviews to know recruiters will find out about your flaws. They might even ask you to talk about them, having knowledge **most people** will lie or, at least, make the flaws lighter than they actually are.

So, I do advocate on taking them off your written resumé at all. It's not lying, its **editing**, showing the important things and putting the less important out.

</Parenthesis>

## Storytelling

There is, of course, some **narrative building** here. I've studied about this, read books, watched documentaries, done courses. I know that a good story sells, so I had this knowledge beforehand and decided to put that to use. What could be my tagline, my sales pitch, my **one-liner**?

I tried writing this a hundred, maybe a **thousand** times. It always sounded one of two: either **posh and entitled**, or **bland and not interesting**. I either could present myself as this _very interesting gentleman with varied taste in the finest things of the industry_ or a _XYZ language coder with knowledge of ABC and DEF technologies_, like many I see around. So, again, I **aimed outwards** and begin **asking questions**.

Most of the people I talked to gave me this one-liner in a plate, almost ready to use.

**"You do a lot of stuff"**.

Some of them said it in a good way, as in "you are **versatile** and finds many ways to solve problems, even outside your area". Others, highlighted this as a warning: "you spread **too thin**, knowing a little about a lot and not a lot about anything". Both of them ended up with the same commonality: I was a **generalist**, not a specialist.

With _lots_ of therapy and some **editorial tailoring**, I got to where I am now. **I am a proud generalist**, can understand most of the problems and, if not solve them, find someone who can.

The best part of this **whole process** (aside having tripled my salary in a year, of course) was: if, at any time, someone found out **I'm not** all that I claimed (hello imposter syndrome), I could always rely on this simple idea: it was **not me** that built that persona, it was **everyone else**. I could tackle anxiety simply by **blaming others** on my shortcomings, because it's not my fault if someone saw something in me that I'm not, it's **their** problem. I'm not bad at describing myself, **they** are the ones that need to **tweak their expectations** on me.

This took a huge weight of my shouldes, specially the famous "you are not that much" that kept pushing me down and down. This might sound as if I was cheating the system but... well, it works, so _sorry, not sorry, society_.

## Getting practical

After getting a nice idea of **what people though of me**, I organised those thoughts (I had noted everything down, as this was a conscient research action), got some tea, and jotted down (in paper! And pen!) the main characteristics they saw in me. From there, I started building this **character**, like in a Roleplaying Game sheet, of who this Angelo everyone saw was.

I put up bullet points of strenghts and weaknesses, highlighted points of improvement, added technical information about the existing topics (eg. they said I was good at coding, but coding _what_ exactly?) and, before I could let the imposter kick in, I had a nice and clear outline of a resumé. I selected some works in which I had put some of those strenghts to practice and bam, resumé ready.

<Parenthesis about="lying in your CV">

In short: **don't**.

If there's something all your colleagues say you excel at, there are good chances they are right. But, if someone says something you know deep down it's a lie, don't take it into consideration.

For instance: let's suppose a friend said I was good at languages. They claim to have seen me speaking to people in Spanish, English, even some Italian or German. That's a nice thing to put in a resumé, "being good at languages", right?

The problem is: that's a lie.

I'm good at English (and not even consider myself fluent). All the other languages are just attempts at communication, German being something I just started learning and Spanish and Italian being close enough to my mother language that I could do some mix-and-match and eventually get some stuff right.

Putting that in my resumé would lead me to interviews that might need those skills and, adding embarassment to the plate, I would just smile and deny when they asked me if I actually spoke those languages. After that, what in my resumé was true? It would become completely not trutworthy.

A real example: I've been working with code for (way too many) years now, and I sure had a few experiences with backend development. I'm absolutely not a backend developer, though. I learnt, with time, to actively say that in interviews so that the recruiter knows I might not be the best fit for a fullstack position.

Even though I've got a colleague that praised me for being able to put up a backend for some services with no prior knowledge, I did not describe it as this in my CV. I preferred saying I was **versatile** and could tacke some challenges **outside my field** of work, as long as everyone knew I was not a specialist in these new explorations and that **things might break**.

Instead of lying, **I chose the truth**, and that has brought me to good places. Maybe it'll lead you too.

</Parenthesis>

With this character sheet — my own, made from parts of me I didn't know or even agree with — I was able to design a resumé, with attached cover letter from this "character", and started sending it everywhere.

Every. Where.

## Second: recruiters are professionals

Go to LinkedIn. Browse to "job search". Put a position you'd like to be in. Be reasonable: don't **sabotage** yourself with lesser positions than you want (because "you are not good enough"). Some would say "don't apply for positions higher than what you think you can do", but **I disagree**. Do exactly that, apply for stuff you think you are not capable of. Apply to **a lot of things**. Trust me, even those positions of leadership, high salary, corner office.

The main point of this section is to **repeat to yourself** that **recruiters are professionals**. They are amazing at their jobs and can **smell talent** from afar. As good professionals they are, they won't turn down a good fit for the company because it does not matches exactly the position. Maybe they are looking for a Chief Technical Officer and you do not have the required experience, but your knowledge of making balloon animals or your interest in entomology might make them want you in their company nonetheless.

Their job description is that: **find and recruit talents**. So, my simple question to you is: who do you think is better in knowing who's a fit for a position? You, **zero recruiting knowledge**, or a person who **does that for a living**?

So, please, **let them do their jobs**. Apply for positions. All of them you'd like to try. Again, be reasoneable, don't apply for "circus manager" if you don't like travelling and are afraid of clowns, save the recruiter's time. Also, if you start a process and don't feel like continuing, quit it and let they know. **Put yourself in their skins**.

We are, usually, **far too traditional** (oh, in so many things) and we do things from tradition without much questioning. What I'm encouraging you to do is: **challenge** whatever tradition pushes you from not applying to the jobs you want. Let **the recruiters** choose and let **them** evaluate if you are a fit or not. Be truthful in interviews, know what you want in a job (through exercises or, well, therapy) and go out there, hunt and be hunted.

## Third: your boss knows best

That shiny contract is signed an you are working in this shiny new environment, with a lot of new responsibilities and a good amount of pressure on your shoulders? Nice. I hope the paycheck is as big as the trouble you just find yourself into (if not, back to step 1).

Now, maybe the problem is not "I'll never find a job" or even "I wont apply for fancy positions". The issue at this point of the process is something I'm still living and, well, trying to tell you to do something I have to do myself.

I always (I mean, **daily**) think **I'm not enough** at my job. Of course they will find out I did all that embelishment of my resumé and that, in truth, I'm a loser and an incompetent and **a really bad professional**. This, as you might know, is **imposter syndrome** at it's best, eating your brain inside out like [that terrifying amoeba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPg-ksxZ4Y). It's easy to say "don't care about that" because I know I do care. My mind (in which I trust most of my decisions to) is constantly reminding me I might be on the **wrong place**.

What I've learnt to do is: evaluate your surroundings and count how **many people failed in their jobs** if you end up being the fraud you believe to be. Start from the last section of this article: if you are this bad of a professional, **your recruiter sucks**. If any of your colleagues ever praised you, they are **bad at judging people** --- personally and professionaly. If you have been through a probation period and passed it, keeping safely employed, **your boss is bad at their job** and just accepted a unfit professional in the company ranks.

A few people, whose jobs are to make sure the company runs smoothly, might have made **horrible mistakes** to keep you there, and the coworkers might be blind and/or amazing liars by saying good things about you to yourself.

Put things in **perspective** whenever the imposter hits. Are you ready to tell all of these people they are **bad at their jobs**? They might be good at it, right? So, maybe, you are not as unfit as you think. You might be even **good at your job**, if you let these "inside" thoughts off and just focus on what comes from outside.

## Fourth: improve to improve

The whole point of this philosophy of letting others judge you, not yourself, for your professional growth, is **exactly** to take advantage of their professionalism and skills in finding capable people. You, instead, must focus on getting your goods **gooder** or your bads at least at **medium**. Instead of trying to **fit in** what you think you should be, work towards **improving**. Tell them you want to get better, **be open** about your weaknesses and true about what you wouldn't want to pursue.

**It's hard to be true to yourself**, I _do_ know. Being true to others, though, brings a paycheck home. We think so many bad things about ourselves and never, for once, think we are bad at judging our own hability. We might see ourselves as the worse professionals, but never as lousy judges of capacity.

**Let the professionals do their jobs**: let others judge your value, not yourself, and be surprised by how much people might think highly of you.
