description: Where I see myself in N+1 years

A question recruiters asks me in almost every interview is:

> Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I usually laugh at that question because, _you know_, we had a global pandemic that threw all our long term plans into the garbage. Five years is a long time for my generation, so I normally answer: alive, in good health, doing something I love.

In order to make this question _fit_ better, I've changed it to:

> Where do you see yourself in N+1 years?

Being _N_ an imaginary number of possible plan-ahead years depending if we are in another pandemic, world war or mass extinction event, I can calculate better what I want to do with my life.

This document is the summary of months of thinking about that dreadful question.
