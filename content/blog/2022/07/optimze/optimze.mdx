You don't need to optimize your time.

Do round trips. Do at your own pace. Don't multitask.

Postpone. Turn down. Give up.

Take time for yourself. Rest when rest is due. Don't use free time to do more, and more, and more. Earn enough to pay the bills (start a realistic budget and stick to it).

Overworking hurts you and your colleagues. Overtime makes work look easier.

Time is meant to be savored, not to be optimized. It's not stretchable or compactable, independently of what Eistein says. In real life, time passes just like that, with no clear measure (the numbers of the clock are lying to you, they are meant to be constant but they obviously show time in variable rates).

Stop what you are doing right now and feel your heartbeats. Are they fast or slow? Breathe. Look around and listen to other people's conversations. Take those earphones off. Pry, eavesdrop, read whatever your neighbor is writing on their phone.

Do silly stuff and spend a whole day under the sheets --- but remember to take a walk to nowhere once in a while. If this is difficult to you (it is to me) come up with a silly goal: "today I'll have a coffee in this far place just because I want to" and walk there.

Deadlines are always a waterfall, remember this. What is needed from you at the 10th is needed by your boss at the 5th, and by their boss at the 1st.

Be late, be early, be on time, on _your_ time. Handle with the consequences --- this is not a manual, follow these words at your consent.

When I worked at the newspaper we used to say "it won't print" when we realised the news were too hot to be able to finish everything on time. "It won't print", we would shout to our colleagues when another change was demanded from management, when the articles doubled in size and the pictures needed to be cut or replaced. "It won't print", we said quietly between ourselves, full of anger and stress, when people acted out of hierarchy and not reason. We would work furiously --- as the funnel of the whole operation, as layout designers --- and send the pages to the printing company at the knack of time.

"It won't print", we would shout, and it always print nonetheless.

We would dream about the rebellious day in where it actually didn't print. A day where things really went crazy and our work, as fast as it could be, couldn't be finished. A day were the journalists didn't have the final version of their articles, the pictures were not treated properly, the bosses finally stopped cursing and started throwing punches. This day never came, it always print.

It will always print, most of the times, so take your time. Everyone can shout, and scream, and throw blame. It will print and another day will come, with another batch of fresh newspaper to be done.
