I had to go through the following process whenever I wanted to create a **new blog post** in my blog â€” powered by **local Markdown** files:

- Get inside the "content" folder
- Navigate to the "blog" folder
- Create a "year" folder
- Create a "month" folder
- Create a "publication" folder
- Add the `md` file with the blog post slug
- Open the `md`
- Open an old, published `md`
- Copy the frontmatter from the old post
- Paste it on the new post
- Clear the data
- Write the metadata
- Update createdAt field
- Start writing

Ugh, that's a **long** (and **boring** list).

This was making me feel not much _programmery_, so I created a **simple script** to automate it. Let's go through it together?

You will be able to do the following at the end of this tutorial:

- Write a CLI command
- Have a `.md` file automatically created
- Have the correct `frontmatter` in this file
- Be in a new `git` branch
- Automatically open `VS Code` (or other) to edit this file

## This tutorial is good for:

- **New developers** that need to lose `terminal` fear
- Anyone who wants to make their workflow **faster**
- People who have locally-hosted MD(X) blogs.

## Setting up the environment

For this small project, you only need to have a project that reads `md` files and that uses `node`. It can be `mdx` or anything else you'd like, honestly. It's not framework specific, so feel free to adapt to your system. My Node version is `v16.14.2` at the moment writing.

Requirements:

- Node
- Node-running project (package.json)
- Yarn (or NPM, your choice)
- **Willpower** and **patience** to research and try/error if something does not match exactly your folder structure and project configuration.

## Concept

Requirements for the script:

- Usable from the **CLI**;
- Two **types** of content (blog or project, in my case);
- Pass the **file name** so the folders and files are created correctly;
- **Automatically** fill `frontmatter` in the new files.

**Pseudo usage**: `{script name} {type} {filename}`

**Example with yarn**:

- Input: `yarn content blog tutorial`
- Output: folders and files for `tutorial.md` are created in the `blog` section, with the `blog` frontmatter.

## Creating the files

At the **root** of the project, I created a `scripts` folder and put a few files we will be using â€” I prefer to split my code:

- content.mjs
- frontmatter.mjs
- getFilename.mjs
- getToday.mjs
- gitNewBranch.mjs
- openInVsCode.mjs

### .mjs?

This file is not a simple javascript file, it is a javascript **module** (hence the `m`). This makes `node` understand the syntax we are using without the need to compile each file before running it.

Inside the `mjs` is plain `javascript` code, so if your IDE complains about the file extensions, **adapt** this to your usage.

PS: There _might_ be some configuration needed in your project. Do a little **research** if some error show up.

## Main file

Let's build a function and call it at the end of the `content.mjs` file:

```mjs
const newContent = () => {}

newContent()
```

In order to test this, we will use `nodemon` â€” a tool that runs `node` scripts in watch mode.

I have it installed **globally** using `yarn global add nodemon`, or you can add it to your project by `yarn add -D nodemon`.

In your console, navigate to the **root** of your project and run `nodemon scripts/content.mjs`. You will see the console waiting for you to **save** the file so it can re-run:

```sh
[nodemon] 2.0.19
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node scripts/content.mjs`
[nodemon] clean exit - waiting for changes before restart
```

## Name and Type

We need to get the file type and name from the CLI (see "Concept", above). `node` gets ,in the `process.argv` property, all that is passed after the script name as items in an array.

So, if I pass `yarn scriptname first second`, I'll get an array with `[node-path, script-path, 'first', 'second']`.

That said, let's add a function to `getFilename.mjs` file and get the filename and type **destructuring** the `process.argv` array.

```mjs
// getFilename.mjs
export const getFilename = () => {
  // Here we omit the two first argument. We don't need them.
  const [, , type, fileName] = process.argv
}
```

We also want to make sure that the script **stops** here if any of these two arguments are not passed:

```mjs
// getFilename.mjs
export const getFilename = () => {
  const [, , type, fileName] = process.argv

  // In my project, I need the type property to match "blog"
  // or "projects" because of the way my folders are organized
  if (!['blog', 'projects'].includes(type)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid type: should be "blog" or "projects"')
  }

  if (!fileName) {
    throw new Error('You need to pass a filename')
  }
}
```

We will need to tell our script **what's the folder** it will save the files we will create in.

Here lies a small **quirk** in `node`. I'm used to getting my directory as `__dirname` in some projects but, by some unknown reason I needed to create my own `__dirname` variable using `fileURLToPath` from the native `url` package, some functions from `path`, and the global `import.meta.url`. This is not the focus of this tutorial, so please just do as I do ðŸ¤“

Inside `join` you should put the **relative path** to where you want your files to be saved. In my case, I want them in the `content` folder, then inside a folder corresponding to the type.

```mjs
// getFilename.mjs
import { dirname, join } from 'path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'

export const getFilename = () => {
  const [, , type, fileName] = process.argv

  if (!['blog', 'projects'].includes(type)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid type: should be "blog" or "projects"')
  }

  if (!fileName) {
    throw new Error('You need to pass a filename')
  }

  const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))
  const contentFolder = join(__dirname, '../', 'content', type)

  return { fileName, type, contentFolder }
}
```

This function returns an object with the **three** necessary variables we need to continue. We will import this function (and destructure it) in our **main** file.

Also, let's include a handy `console.log` to tell us the script is starting.

```mjs
// content.mjs

import { getFilename } from './getFilename.mjs'

const newContent = () => {
  const { fileName, type, contentFolder } = getFilename()

  console.log(`Trying to create a new ${type} content: ${fileName}.md`)
}

newContent()
```

If you save now you should see this message printed in your console.

```sh
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node scripts/tutorial.mjs blog filename`
Trying to create a new blog content: filename.md
[nodemon] clean exit - waiting for changes before restart
```

## Date

To create our `md` files in the correct folders, we will get the **current month** and **year** from our `getToday` function. Let's start it.

```mjs
// getToday.mjs

export const getToday = () => {
  const dateObj = new Date()
}
```

We need to get `day`, `month` and `year` from the date object. Let's do it by creating these three variables:

```mjs
// getToday.mjs

export const getToday = () => {
  const dateObj = new Date()

  const month = (dateObj.getUTCMonth() + 1).toString()
  const day = dateObj.getUTCDate().toString()
  const year = dateObj.getUTCFullYear().toString()
}
```

Notes about the code above:

- In `node` `Date`, months start in `0`, so January is not `1`. To circumvent that. we add `1` to the function that gets the month.
- We transform every number to string to **avoid errors** when creating the files and folders.
- Yes, `getUTCDate` is different from `getUTCDay`. We **all** end up learning that one day.

There's a **problem** with the code above: when returning months smaller than October, it returns them with a single digit: `5`. In folder organization, it's best to add a `0` before this so it orders correctly, **avoiding** the following ordering:

- 10
- 11
- 1
- 2
- 3

And **enforcing** this:

- 01
- 02
- 03
- 10
- 11

Let's add a simple helper function that does that for us and return the variables at the end.

```mjs
// getToday.mjs

export const getToday = () => {
  const addZero = number =>
    number < 10 ? '0' + number.toString() : number.toString()

  const dateObj = new Date()
  const month = addZero(dateObj.getUTCMonth() + 1)
  const day = addZero(dateObj.getUTCDate().toString())
  const year = dateObj.getUTCFullYear().toString()

  return [year, month, day]
}
```

I only added the `day` to the above function so you could customize your output. I'm **not** using it, so we'll only destructure `month` and `year` in the main file:

```mjs
// content.mjs

import { getFilename } from './getFilename.mjs'
import { getToday } from './getToday.mjs'

const newContent = () => {
  const { fileName, type, contentFolder } = getFilename()

  console.log(`Trying to create a new ${type} content: ${fileName}.md`)

  const [year, month] = getToday() // <<<<
}

newContent()
```

**Important**: This file will get **quite big**, so I'll try to cut out parts that we don't use from it. Whenever you see `// ...`, it means that the code before or after this sign was **untouched**.

Now, with this data in our hands, we can build our **folder** path, joining all current information:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { join } from 'path'
// ...

// ...
const [year, month] = getToday()

  const folderPath = join(contentFolder, year, month, fileName)
}

newContent()
```

## Creating folders & files

We split this section into two parts: **folder** and **file**, and there's a reason for it.

### Folder

To create the folders and files in a **safe** way â€” not overwriting anything â€” we have first to check if it **exists** and, if not, create them using a special option in `fs`'s `mkdirSync`.

As the name says, `mkdirSync` is a **synchronous** function that creates directories. It can be **recursive**, creating any non-existant directory in a tree.

If I pass `mkdirSync('src/1/2/3/4/5')` and only `src/1` exists, the function will throw an error. But, if I add the `{ recursive: true }` option, it will create all missing folders **without** error.

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from 'fs'
// ...

// ...
  const folderPath = join(contentFolder, year, month, fileName)

  if (!existsSync(folderPath)) {
    mkdirSync(folderPath, { recursive: true })
  }
}

newContent()
```

First, we check if the folder path **exists**. If it was not created beforehand, it's created now in a **recursive** way.

### File

In order to get the file name, we use the already created `folderPath` variable.

The issue is: what if the file **already exists?** In my use-case, I prefer to **throw** an error instead of overwriting.

Imagine I **accidentally** type `yarn scriptname blog amazing` when I already have a file called `amazing` in this month? I don't want to lose that content (yeah, I'm using `git`, but you get my point).

So, I add a **failsafe** to that:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from 'fs'
// ...

// ...
  if (!existsSync(folderPath)) {
    mkdirSync(folderPath, { recursive: true })
  }

  const folderAndFilename = `${folderPath}/${fileName}.md`

  if (existsSync(folderAndFilename)) {
    throw new Error(
      "There's already a file with that name in this month's folder"
    )
  }
}

newContent()
```

## Writing the file

Finally, to (almost) end our struggle, we can **write** the file. We know that:

- The folders are created
- The file name is set
- The file does not exist

We are safe to continue, so let's plop this `writeFileSync` from `fs` there and get **done** with this:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from 'fs'
// ...

// ...
  if (existsSync(folderAndFilename)) {
    throw new Error(
      "There's already a file with that name in this month's folder"
    )
  }

  writeFileSync(folderAndFilename, '')
}

newContent()
```

As the **first** argument, we pass the intended file path. As the **second**, we pass what we want written in this file â€” at the moment, **nothing**.

VoilÃ¡. **Done**. We have ourselves an automatic `md` file written in the correct folder for us.

But... that's a little... **not that much**, right? What if we could already populate it with some template?

## Frontmatter templates

In our `frontmatter.mjs` file, we will create an object with our desired **frontmatter**. At the moment, we have two types: `blog` and `projects`, so each will have its own frontmatter.

Another thing we will do with this template is **automatically** set the `createdAt` property filled with... today. My blog uses timestamps, but you can pre-fill anything you want, any way you want.

```mjs
// frontmatter.mjs

export const frontmatter = {
  blog: `---
title:
createdAt: ${new Date().getTime()}
description:
tags: []
---

Write here
`,
  projects: `---
title:
description:
createdAt: ${new Date().getTime()}
tags: []
image:
  src:
  alt:
---

Write here
`,
}
```

The spacing is weird **on purpose**, make sure it has no whitespace before each line to avoid **errors** in your frontmatter.

Now, on our main file, let's pass this new information to our `writeFileSync` function â€” with a little `console.log` telling everyone of our **accomplishments**:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from 'fs'
// ...

// ...
  writeFileSync(folderAndFilename, frontmatter[type])
  console.log(`${fileName}.md created succesfully!`)
}

newContent()
```

> But Angelo, what happens if we pass a `type` that doesn't match the object?

**We won't**! Remember that this function throws an **error** if you pass any type other than `blog` and `projects`!

## Finale (?)

**This is the end** of the main part of this tutorial.

But there's more to be done, because we are developers and we are absolutely **lazy**!

Our computer is doing all of this by itself and we still have to create a branch in git for this new file, and navigate to it **manually**, like the Aztecs? Oh no, not today.

## Auto git-branch

In `gitNewBranch.mjs` file, we will write a simple function using the powers of `simple-git` package. There's nothing much to be said here: if you understand `git` a little bit, you will be able to decypher the following code with ease.

But, before, **install** the package using `yarn add -D simple-git`.

```mjs
// gitNewBranch.mjs

import { simpleGit } from 'simple-git'

export const gitNewBranch = async (type, fileName) => {
  console.log('Creating branch and commiting...')
  await simpleGit()
    .checkout('main')
    .checkoutLocalBranch(`${type}/${fileName}`)
    .add('./*')
    .commit('Add starter MD')
}
```

**Important**: see the little `async` in the first line? Yeah, `simpleGit` is **asynchronous** so we will use `async/await` here to make it work **perfectly**.

Before the `simpleGit` function, plop that `await` there.

We need to make two changes in our main function: add an `async` flag and add `await` before calling the `gitNewBranch` function:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { gitNewBranch } from './gitNewBranch.mjs'
// ...

//...
const newContent = async () => {
  //...

  // ...
  console.log(`${fileName}.md created succesfully!`)

  await gitNewBranch(type, fileName)
}

newContent()
```

## Opening VS Code

To **finalize** our script, we will command our terminal to open the file in our **favorite** IDE â€” in my case, VS Code.

This is the **most obfuscated** of all of the files. It takes advantage of `exec` from node's `child-process`. It's **hard** to read and to explain. What it does is simple: it runs in your terminal whatever you pass on the `exec` first argument.

We will use the `code` command, as if we were opening a file from our **terminal**. If something goes wrong, an **error** will be logged.

```mjs
// openInVsCode.mjs
import { exec } from 'child_process'

export const openInVSCode = pathAndFileName => {
  exec(`code ${pathAndFileName}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    console.log(stdout)
    if (error !== null) {
      console.log(stderr)
    }
  })
}
```

Yeah, I know, **not** the best file. But, if you can open `code` using your terminal, you can also use it this way. We will add it to the **end** of our main file:

```mjs
// content.mjs
import { openInVSCode } from './openInVsCode.mjs'
// ...

// ...
  await gitNewBranch(type, fileName)

  openInVSCode(folderAndFilename)
}

newContent()
```

And that's it!

## Package.json

I **promise** this is the last step! I swear!

We will add two scripts in our `package.json` to make this even **easier**.

```json
  "scripts": {
		// ...
    "post": "node ./scripts/content.mjs blog",
    "project": "node ./scripts/content.mjs projects"
  },
```

This way, when we `yarn post tutorial`:

- Our script will create a folder with today's year and month
- It will add a `tutorial` folder
- Inside it, it will create a `tutorial.md` file
- It will populate this file with `frontmatter.blog` content
- It will create a new branch in `git` and checkout there: `blog/tutorial`
- It will open VS Code for you to write your file.

Want proof? There you go.

That's all of it.

Thanks for reading and let me know if you end up implementing this.

**Don't forget to share this post with everyone!**

Final content of our main file:

```mjs
import { existsSync, mkdirSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs'
import { join } from 'path'
import { frontmatter } from './frontmatter.mjs'
import { getFilename } from './getFilename.mjs'
import { getToday } from './getToday.mjs'
import { gitNewBranch } from './gitNewBranch.mjs'
import { openInVSCode } from './openInVsCode.mjs'

const newContent = async () => {
  const { fileName, type, contentFolder } = getFilename()

  console.log(`Trying to create a new ${type} content: ${fileName}.md`)

  const [year, month] = getToday()
  const folderPath = join(contentFolder, year, month, fileName)

  if (!existsSync(folderPath)) {
    mkdirSync(folderPath, { recursive: true })
  }

  const folderAndFilename = `${folderPath}/${fileName}.md`

  if (existsSync(folderAndFilename)) {
    throw new Error(
      "There's already a file with that name in this month's folder"
    )
  }

  writeFileSync(folderAndFilename, frontmatter[type])
  console.log(`${fileName}.md created succesfully!`)

  await gitNewBranch(type, fileName)
  openInVSCode(folderAndFilename)
}

await newContent()
```
