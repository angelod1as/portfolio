I write this blog post before the actual blog development is started.

I chose to do so to commit myself to some ground rules.

My website today is much more a weird portfolio, focused on generalism and LOTS of text, than a website to actually showcase my work.

WEBSITE PHOTO

I love the mosaic design, but I'd like to say more with fewer clicks. To achieve that I'm going to follow these simple development guidelines (or, in better terms, the scope of this project):

- The development will be done with:
  - NextJS
  - MDX
  - TailwindCSS
- The website will feature:
  - A blog
  - A podcast page (questions and presentation)
  - A better design (done using Figma)
- I'll scratch
  - Two languages
  - Any CMS
  - Notion integration

## NextJS, MDX and TailwindCSS

My website was once made using Gatsby, then moved to NextJS (a very good choice). I'll continue with NextJS (even though I almost went with Svelte), but I'll drop any CMSs.

I'll no longer use Contentful. These CMSs are great for corporate development, but when I come up with a new feature for a single page, the CMS blocks me (because they have their own data structure).

So, to avoid that, I went simple. MDX files will give me all Markdown power with the possibility to add custom components. TailwindCSS and its amazing JIT feature make me write almost zero CSS (which is fast and light).

That maybe will get me more will to write a new blog post or add new work or related to the portfolio section.

## New design

The new design was done using Figma and you can check it out by clicking below.

## Why did you drop the Portuguese Brazilian language?

Maintaining a two languages blog was going to be hard, REAL hard. Actually, even updating the portfolio and having to write the same thing twice... well, not very encouraging.

Also, I don't think that anyone that visits this website doesn't know a little English. Think about it: I'm a developer, and I'll be soon enough living outside of Brazil, most of my friends speak English, and, well, the audience (I think) this blog's targets are made of English speakers.
