Angelo defines himself as an agnostic tarot reader. He is not into crystals, candles or aliens. He's deep into understanding tarot meanings and symbology, as a means to understand ourselves in our present moment — as if the cards were asking the unwanted questions.

## Agnosticism

Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term *agnostic* with the meaning we know now in 1869. In his view, everything lacking ways of proving should't be confirmed — not meaning the subject doesn't exists, only that we should research the researchable and let the not researchable just *be*.

According to philosopher William Rowe, if god is impossible to be proven with the scientific method, that can only mean that *god is impossible to be proven*, not that he exists or not.

From that thought, Angelo sees himself as an agnostic tarot reader. He's not interested in proving that tarot *works* (whatever that means) or that the ebb and flow of the universe has an origin or an ending — a single god or multiple ones, angels or demons, etc.

His job as a tarot reader is to *interpret* the *combination* of a *set of cards* based on the *acquired meaning* of each card.

### Interpret

Angelo prefers not to know what the person he's reading for — the consulent — wants to *ask the cards*. He prefers to put them in front of him, read each one's meaning and make the necessary connection. He hopes they make sense for the consulent... and almost every time they do.

### Combination

He usually reads the traditional Celtic Cross spread. He chose this spread because of the large number of users and its traditionality. He's eager to learn new spreads and ways to use them.

### Set of cards

Angelo reads Rider-Waite-Smith's deck. He prefer these cards because they were his first and their design has a lot of symbolism. He's always looking for a new deck to read from, but let's say they have never *called him* like th RWS's has.

### Acquired meaning

Angelo has a christian background, so of course his symbolic understanding comes from a christian basis. But, as a major part in his agnostic reading, he's always trying to learn new symbol relationships from other cultures and religions, even trying to rip these references off and read the card as religion-free as possible.

He understands and respects his religious peers. He even recommends that, if looking for religious (or religious-based) guidance, the consulent should contact these individuals and not him.

## Booking

At the moment, he gives *in loco* and online readings. You can contact him through [angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br](mailto:angelo@angelodias.com.br) with 'Tarot' as subject.

<!-- ## Start

His relationship with tarot started after a reading given by a friend. Angelo, doubtful, accepted the reading and, open-minded, saw that the cards were pointing to something he didn't want to acknowledge.

After his first — and fantastic — experience, he soon bought his Rider-Waite-Smith deck and started reading books and websites about the practice. -->
