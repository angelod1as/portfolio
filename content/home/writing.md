From serious journalism to not-so-serious fiction, Angelo never stops writing. Even before journalism school he tried to create stories, characters and settings from scratch. There, he learnt how to tell  compelling narratives from simple facts, organizing and displaying them harmoniously.

Since then, he wrote a few pieces about comics and games for Folha de S.Paulo, comics scripts about beer for a niche magazine, fake news for his fake newspaper and short stories for himself.

Writing a full-fledged novel is still on his plans. He's still deciding if it will involve space travel or urban fantasy. Or both. Or neither.

At the moment, he writes for [Tempos Fant√°sticos](/newspaper), and is slowly getting back to fiction writing. He'd love to write on demand and produce journalistic content, mainly if the subject is around graphic novels and videogames. He surely can write about other [*stuff*](/stuff) too.

This portfolio is a clear example as he can go on for ages putting word after word. Some people told him to write less... but he didn't listen. He preferred to show off those skills by doing.
