Through a specific angle, this whole website is an *About* page. Everything Angelo does can be characterized as *work*, in a way, so this page will only talk about what he does that isn't working.

## All work and no play

Angelo lives at São Paulo downtown, Brazil, in a non-monogamic relationship with his significant other — they are very verbal about it. Two cute dogs accompany their journey.

His parents are dead, sadly, but he got a lot of siblings, some of them 20 years younger. Take that, gerational gap.

He loves what most of 30-somethings love nowadays: graphic novels, movies, series, ocasional partying with killer hangover, etc.

Want to go deeper? Ok, then.

## Games

Gaming is his favorite activity and media, as he'd love to study it's storytelling and emergent narratives.

He's interested in base-building games like [RimWorld](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/08/12/how-rimworld-generates-great-stories/) and [Oxygen not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/). He loves games that challenge narrative, like [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/). He frequently visits Reddit's [Broken Mouse Convention](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/) for his incremental game fix.

## Books

His favorite author is Terry Pratchett and says that everyone should read Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staple's Saga. Yes, he puts *books* and *graphic novels* under the same category: literature.

He gets kinda angry when people talk about *high literature*, as it doesn't exists and is only used to segregate and mock.

His love for science fiction got him reading Asimov, H. G. Wells and K. Dick. Now, he's Becky Chambers' *HUGE* fan and want's to read everything she writes down. He also loves comedy, as the aforementioned Terry Pratchett should hint. If you like it too, you should read Christopher Moore.

## Music

His taste in music is... peculiar. *Tool* peculiar. [*Detektivbyrån*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBU3waTWrv8) peculiar. WEIRD.

You can listen to his a-thousand-songs playlist, named "best songs" in portuguese, to understand his taste. It's... a nice mix of music.

## Travel

Angelo travelled the world alongside his family when his father was alive. He always tried to find ways to talk about this subject without sounding like an idiot bragging but hasn't found how. So, to make this as short as it should be, here's a list of countries he has visited:

- USA
- Canada
- Dominican Republic
- England
- Spain
- France
- Italy
- Turkey

His absolute favourites were Italy and Turkey.

## What else?

This website is meant to be his 'all Angelo does' place but, as he's always so freaking busy, it's probably outdated and lacking a few words.

I hope you can get in touch with him sending an email through [angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br](mailto:angelo@angelodias.com.br) or clicking his social media buttons at the [home](/) page.

He's always eager to chat and find what kind of *stuff* he can make with people.
