<!-- TODO lacking images -->

Through a specific angle, this whole website is an *About* page. Everything I do can be characterized as *work*, in a way, so this page will only talk about what I do that isn't working.

<!-- TODO: Currículo "oficial" e BORING em PDF -->

## All work and no play

I live in downtown São Paulo, Brazil, in a non-monogamic relationship with my significant other — we are very outspoken about it. Two cute dogs accompany us on our journey.

My parents are dead, sadly, but I has a lot of siblings, some of them 20 years younger. Take that, generational gap.

I love what most 30-somethings love nowadays: graphic novels, movies, tv series, occasional partying followed by a killer hangover, etc.

Want to go deeper? Ok, then.

## Games

Gaming is my favorite media and activity. I'd love to study it's storytelling and emergent narratives.

I'm interested in base-building games such as [RimWorld](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/08/12/how-rimworld-generates-great-stories/) and [Oxygen not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/). I love games that challenge narrative, like [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/). I frequently visits Reddit's [Broken Mouse Convention](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/) for my incremental game fix.

## Books

My favorite author is Terry Pratchett and I think that everyone should read Brian K. Vaughan's and Fiona Staple's Saga. Yes, I put *books* and *graphic novels* under the same category: literature.

I get kinda angry when people talk about *literary fiction*, as it doesn't exist and is only used to segregate and mock.

My love for science fiction got me reading Asimov, H. G. Wells and Philip K. Dick. Now, I'm Becky Chambers' *BIGGEST* fan and want to read everything she writes. I also love comedy, as the aforementioned Terry Pratchett should hint. If you like it too, you should read Christopher Moore.

## Music

My taste in music is... peculiar. *Tool* peculiar. [*Detektivbyrån*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBU3waTWrv8) peculiar. WEIRD.

You can listen to my a-thousand-songs playlist, named "best songs" (in Portuguese), to understand my taste. It's... a nice mix of music.

## Travel

I traveled the world alongside my family when my father was alive. Here's a list of countries I have visited:

- USA
- Canada
- Dominican Republic
- England
- Spain
- France
- Italy
- Turkey

My absolute favorites were Italy and Turkey.

## What else?

This website is meant to be my 'all Angelo does' place but, as I'm always so freaking busy, it's probably outdated and lacking a few words.

I hope you can get in touch with me by sending an email through [angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br](mailto:angelo@angelodias.com.br) or clicking my social media buttons at the [home](/) page.

I'm always eager to chat and find what kind of *stuff* I can do with people.

## Why

Before going technical, I like to *go philosophical*.

At first, I thought about building that awesome portfolio, with killer design, neat interactions and a lot of things that would get the 'wow factor' from visitors.

Then, I realised that *my work* should do that, not a portfolio page by itself.

That's why I chose to build a Gatsby website (read more below). Fast page loading, indexed content, lightweight and easily editable. I chose to make something easily updatable and *good to navigate*. My mind focused on me, the writer, and you, the reader.

So, you want to see some hard-to-execute and prize winning projects? [Cool, I made something like that, click here to see them](/coding). Want to see fast and customizable personal websites? You are visting one of them right now.

You know what? I could make one of these for you. Email me at [angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br](mailto:angelo@angelodias.com.br).

## How

These pages were built using the power of [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Gatsby**](https://gatsbyjs.org). The content is managed and hosted by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

It's a [**Delicious JAMstack!**](https://jamstack.org/)

Fonts are from the amazing [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Montserrat Alternates for titles and Montserrat for text.

You can see the public project [here](https://github.com/angelod1as/portfolio). Feel free to fork the repository.

Check the link above for the Gatsby plugins I used to make this possible. He's in love with Gatsby, although working with images is *painful as hell*.
