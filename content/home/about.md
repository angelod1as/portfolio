>>> FALTAM IMAGENS

Angelo is a morning person — opposed to his mostly nocturnal peers. This characteristic can be seen as simply uncommon or, when living with him and noticing his smiling joy at 6 am, almost psychopatic.

His time, from ungodly early to late at night, is invested, as he says, "making stuff".

*Stuff*.

One very singular example of *stuff* he does is his three-year-running satirical newspaper, Tempos Fantásticos. After thinking how to mix journalism, design and science-fiction, he designed, wrote and sold the newspapers' first edition. It was pretty bad. Gladly, three or four years can greatly improve a publication.

Another of this *stuff* is... well, this website. He loves to code and is eager to learn new technologies. Beyond paid work, like quizes, data-driven search tools and storytelling platforms, he's excited to take part in new digital projects, some of them still *very* secret.

## All work and no play

Oh, life would be damned if work was all we did... and that's mainly what Angelo does. He loves taking part in new projects and is always searching new *stuff* to make.

When not making *stuff* in real life, he's making them playing base-buinding games like [RimWorld](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/08/12/how-rimworld-generates-great-stories/) and Oxygen not Included. Gaming is his favorite activity and media, as he'd love to study it's storytelling and emergent narratives.

He loves what most of 30-somethings love nowadays: graphic novels, movies, series, ocasional partying with killer hangover, etc. His favorite author is Terry Pratchett and says that everyone should read Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staple's Saga. His taste in music is... peculiar. *Tool* peculiar. [*Detektivbyrån*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBU3waTWrv8). WEIRD.

One of the *stuff* he makes is [music](https://soundcloud.com/angelod1as), but he's very amateur at it.

He lives at São Paulo downtown, Brazil, in a non-monogamic relationship with his significant other — they are very verbal about it. Two cute dogs accompany their journey. He'd love to travel for work.

*Really, he'd LOVE to work abroad.*

## What else?

This website is meant to be his 'all I do' place but, as he's always so freaking busy, it's probably outdated and lacking a few words.

I hope you can get in touch with him sending an email through angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br or clicking his social media buttons at the [home](/) page.

He's always eager to chat and find what kind of *stuff* he can make with people.

## I'd like to work:

- Mixing design, coding and journalism.
- Remotely
- As an alternative model (everyone can dream)
- As a fulltime fiction writer (everyone can dream, right?)
