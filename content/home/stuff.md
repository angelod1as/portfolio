Albeit disagreeing with the aforementioned *little value*, Angelo always thought cool starting articles with dictionary citations.

## Stuff

Angelo is a morning person — as opposed to his mostly nocturnal peers. This characteristic can be seen as simply uncommon or, when living with him and noticing his joyful smile at 6 am, as almost psychopatic.

His time (from ungodly early to late at night) is invested, as he says, "making stuff".

*Stuff*.

One very singular example of *stuff* he does is his three-year-running satirical newspaper, Tempos Fantásticos. After thinking how to mix journalism, design and science-fiction, he designed, wrote and sold the newspapers' first edition. It was pretty bad. Gladly, three or four years can greatly improve a publication.

Another of this *stuff* is... well, this website. He loves to code and is eager to learn new technologies. Beyond paid work, he likes quizzes, data-driven search tools and storytelling platforms. He's excited to take part in new digital projects, some of them still *very* secret.

*Stuff* is what makes his heart beat and what keeps his cogs in motion. He's equipped and skilled to do a lot of *stuff*. While in Journalism school, one of his teachers said:

> "You should become multimedia professionals: not only writers, but video editors, moviemakers, programmers and, when possible, all of that combined"

As it seems, he kept that advice as a promise to himself.

## Renaissance man

Obviously he woudn't be an idiot and call himself a "renaissance man" (nor put the term as a subtitle of one of his articles). Apart from that, the term describes his abilities very well. He can do a *shitload* of *stuff* and even likes to be a (god forbid!) generalist.

You read it right. He's a generalist and kinda proud of it.

Angelo can:

- build websites from the ground;
- write endless lines of code;
- write endless pages of fiction;
- design for print and digital;
- manage project(s);
- cook a killer cheese quiche;
- try to be funny when he should be serious.

Whoa, that's a big list... and that doesn't even scrach the surface of what he does.

If you read this far, I recommend clicking here and going back to the main page. There you can explore more *stuff* he does and even know him better, like, knowing what he does when he's not working — like, never.

## He'd like to work:

- Mixing design, coding and journalism;
- Remotely;
- Abroad — he's from Brazil;
- As an alternative model (one can dream);
- As a fulltime fiction writer (one can dream, *right*?).
