## What

*[Tempos Fantásticos](https://www.temposfantasticos.com/)* is my main project. It's an excuse to mix fiction writing, layout design, web development and more skills into this singular piece of art. It's a newspaper with journalistic language — admittedly fake; a design project, from main graphic project to each particular issue; a website with an online store and backend tools to manage subscribers and buyers; and every other week a newsletter with updates and fresh (fake) news.

In its current form, *[Tempos Fantásticos](https://www.temposfantasticos.com/)* has eight colored A3 pages (two folded A2 pages). All its texts and illustrations are voluntary collaborations, and all we charge is directed to the maintenance of the project — print, mail, servers. Digital copies are free forever after the next issue is released. It's sadly available only in Portuguese.

## When

The project started in February 2016 and exists ever since.

## Where

The bulk of the work is made by myself, in downtown São Paulo, Brazil, but we have collaborators from all around the country, even one that used to live in the USA.

## Who

Nowadays the project is maintained by a team of five singular individuals: myself, João P. Lima, Jana P. Bianchi, Raphael Andrade and Ludimila Honorato. Each of them has their share of skills and experiences — like Ludimila's (serious) work at Estadão newspaper and Raphael's (also serious) background in design and advertising.

## Why

"Why not?" is a question frequently asked by our team. We have two dreams: one that's more plausible, which is bringing quality and fun short literature to readers around the country... and the other one a little more, let's say, *fantastic*. The project hopes to be recognized in the future as one of the main actors in Brazilian sci-fi revival, making a dent in history by changing how stories are presented. That sounds like a far away dream, but isn't every dream?

## How

All the newspaper's layout is made usign Adobe InDesign. The texts are written at Google Docs and our (almost endless) tasks are managed through Trello.ore culpa dolor velit ut voluptate et eu deserunt.
