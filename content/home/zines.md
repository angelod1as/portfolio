Angelo's zines talk about... anything. He has one about his first date with a girl, another one about death and a small one about some translated ancient chinese script — obviously false.

While working on many projects, Angelo found himself in need of artistic expression without traditional boundaries. As he's not so good with this "zero boundaries" thing, he created his own.

The chosen format was two A4 papers folded and stapled — A5 result. After meeting Márcio Sno, Angelo started doing minizines — A7 sized, 16 pages. Printed at home or at the cheap xerox place, his zines express thoughts and ideas that *could* be better expressed... but lack the time and money needed.

He plans to make a 12 issue collections — inspired by Aline Valek — but couldn't find the time yet. On a second thought, he should do a zine about not finding time. Nice.
