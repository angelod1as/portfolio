Bits and bytes, beeps and blops (what a terrible start). Lacking the required skills to play traditional musical instruments â€” and with enough knowledge in music theory, I found *electronic music* as a last resort in my search of a musical career.

I've been failing ever since.

I keep making weird music and would love to work composing for video games.

I like working with Ableton Live and a Ableton Push 2. My music-making process is complex and difficult to explain. In short: I press the buttons and, if it sounds good, I record.

My inspirations come from various subjects. I explain a bit about each of them on their respective pages.
