Bits and bytes, beeps and blops (what a terrible start). Lacking the required skills to play traditional musical instruments â€” and with enough knowledge in music theory, Angelo found *electronic music* as a last resort in his search of a musical career.

He's been failing ever since.

He keeps making weird music and would love to work composing for video games.

Angelo likes working with Ableton Live and a Ableton Push 2. His music-making process is complex and difficult to explain. In short: he presses the buttons and, if it sounds good, he records.

His inspirations come from various subjects. He explains a bit about each of them on their respective pages.
