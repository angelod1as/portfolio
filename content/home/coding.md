Angelo identified the lack of programmers amongst his community and decided to learn it by himself. It's safe to say he learned coding by doing it.

This makes him versatile, eager and capable to learn new languages and workflows. His path points to web development, mainly front-end, but he wouldn't say no to a different proposal and would love to be a part of a multidisciplinary and multicultural team.
