Angelo identified the lack of programmers amongst his community and decided to learn it by himself. It's safe to say he learnt coding by doing.

This makes him versatile and eager to learn new languages and workflows. His path points to web development, mainly front-end, but he wouldn't say no to a different proposal and would love to be part of a multidisciplinar and multicultural team.
