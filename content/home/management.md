Angelo likes taking part in new projects, but what he really loves is managing them. He had a hunch about this while playing games — base-building, complex-systems, intricate-strategies games — but only after studying Project Management post-grad at Mackenzie University, in São Paulo, that he figured out this was another one of his passions.

His most recent management activity is his sci-fi satirical newspaper [Tempos Fantásticos](/). His tasks go from managing finances to building and maintaining publishing schedules. He also travels to fairs and events as one of the project's faces. You can read more about his role at Tempos Fantásticos [here](/).

Unfortunately, he has never worked as a paid manager, although having that responsability in many projects, as Folha de S.Paulo's [Climate Crisis](/).

One of his attributions was the development and maintenance of a complex schedule of journalists, photographers, video and photo editors and programmers. His task was vital to the project, as each chapters' deadline was short and overlapped these professionals travels or other tasks.

He also has experience in multidisciplinar mediation. Folha de S.Paulo's [A World of Walls](/) was managed mainly by desk editor Luciana Coelho, but Angelo had as one of his tasks to facilitate comunication between journalists, designers, programmers, photographers, translators, photo and video editors and management. Making sure the project was on schedule and that everyone knew what was happening was urgent — explaining each other's work is like speaking different languages.

He's open to positions in which management takes part. He'd love to work with multidisciplinar and multicultural teams, to learn more about Agile management and to work in an Agile environment.
