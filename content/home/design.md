Angelo doesn't just 'know softwares'. **He's a professional Layout Designer**.

Five years at Folha de S.Paulo, Latin America's bigger newspaper, taught him a lot about organizing content in limited spaces, being those the margins of a page or the kb limit on a file.

## Work

Before moving to coding, Angelo built *a lot* of pages at Folha de S.Paulo. You can see his (very amateur) beginner work [here](/http://be.net/angelod1as). They are a few years old, before Folha's new graphic project, but shows that he already knew what he wanted to work with: **sharp colors**, **whitespace** and **contrast**.

After moving his focus to coding, he kept those keyords in mind. As he didn't want to loose what was a growing passion, he did what he could to keep designing [*stuff*](/stuff).

His current layout design job is [Tempos Fant√°sticos](/newspaper). Using Adobe InDesign, he plans and executes each issue, with fixed and moving parts, variable article lenghts and multiple illustrations direction.

He also does smaller jobs, like folders and [slides](/). Actually, he does whatever he identifies with, being that a large project for a mega company or a small hobby project with friends.

Design is something he'll never stop loving, no matter where the world takes him.
