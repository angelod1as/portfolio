I don't just 'know softwares'. **I'm a professional Layout Designer**.

Five years at Folha de S.Paulo, Latin America's bigger newspaper, taught me a lot about organizing content in limited spaces, being those the margins of a page or the kb limit on a file. [You can read about my digital work here](/websites).

## Work

Before moving to coding, I built *a lot* of pages at Folha de S.Paulo. This link showcases some of the pages I liked to design at the time. They are a few years old, before Folha's new graphic project, but show that I already knew what I wanted to work with: sharp colors, whitespace, contrast.

After moving my focus to coding, I kept those keyords in mind. As I didn't want to loose what was a growing passion, I did what I could to keep designing [*stuff*](/about).

My current layout design job is [Tempos Fantásticos](/tf). Using Adobe InDesign, I plan and execute each issue, with fixed and moving parts. Check some of the pages below:

I also do smaller jobs, like folders and slides — which, I know, are not *print*, but their design is closer to print than coding a website. Some examples below.
