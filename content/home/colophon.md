>>> FALTAM IMAGENS

## Why

Before going technical, I like to *go philosophical*.

At first, I thought about building that awesome portfolio, with killer design, neat interactions and a lot of things that would get the 'wow' from visitors.

Then, I realised that my work should do that, not my portfolio by itself.

That's why I chose to build a Gatsby website (read more below). Fast page loading, indexed content, lightweight and easy editable. I chose to make something easily updatable and *good to navigate*. My mind focused on me, the writer, and you, the reader.

So you want to see some hard-to-execute and prize winning projects? [Nice, I made some, click here to see them](/portfolio). Want to see fast and customizable personal websites? You are visting one of them right now.

You know what? I could make one of these for you. Email me at angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br.

## How

These pages were built using the power of [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Gatsby**](https://gatsbyjs.org). The content is managed and hosted by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

It's a [**Delicious JAMstack!**](https://jamstack.org/)

Fonts are from amazing [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Montserrat Alternates for titles and Montserrat for text.

You can see the public project [here](https://github.com/angelod1as/portfolio). Feel free to fork the repository.

Check the link above for the Gatsby's plugins I used to make this possible. I'm in love with Gatsby, although working with images is *painful as hell*.
