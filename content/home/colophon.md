## Why

Before going technical, Angelo likes to *go philosophical*.

At first, he thought about building that awesome portfolio, with killer design, neat interactions and a lot of things that would get the 'wow factor' from visitors.

Then, he realised that *his work* should do that, not a portfolio page by itself.

That's why he chose to build a Gatsby website (read more below). Fast page loading, indexed content, lightweight and easily editable. He chose to make something easily updatable and *good to navigate*. His mind focused on him, the writer, and you, the reader.

So, you want to see some hard-to-execute and prize winning projects? [Cool, he made something, click here to see them](/coding). Want to see fast and customizable personal websites? You are visting one of them right now.

You know what? Angelo could make one of these for you. Email him at [angelo\[at\]angelodias.com.br](mailto:angelo@angelodias.com.br).

## How

These pages were built using the power of [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Gatsby**](https://gatsbyjs.org). The content is managed and hosted by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

It's a [**Delicious JAMstack!**](https://jamstack.org/)

Fonts are from the amazing [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Montserrat Alternates for titles and Montserrat for text.

You can see the public project [here](https://github.com/angelod1as/portfolio). Feel free to fork the repository.

Check the link above for the Gatsby plugins Angelo used to make this possible. He's in love with Gatsby, although working with images is *painful as hell*.
