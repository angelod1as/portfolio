Looking for an escape from traditional publishing standards — while working at Folha de S.Paulo and [Tempos Fantásticos](/projects/tempos_fantasticos) — I found zines and zine culture.

I decided to make zines in any way I wanted, without following set rules or schedule. In order to do that, I set up my first React website, also my first e-commerce, and started selling these publications in a pay-what-you-want way (influenced by [Panel Syndicate](http://panelsyndicate.com/))

## Design

I wanted the website to be as simple as possible, without screen changes and making everything showing up at the same moment. The design was influenced by my need to learn React and the way its states communicate. In retrospect, I'd do it all again using Redux.

As the zines would be printed in black and white, with a LOT of whitespace, I chose this contrasted look as my design choice.

## Coding

This was my **first ever** React website. The code might be messy, but it was a great learning experience. [See it here, feel free to fork it](https://github.com/angelod1as/cronofobia). According to Wakatime, it took about 20 hours of coding only, not including layout.

I thank Pilker, Rubens Fernandes, Thiago Almeida and Lucas Golino for the boilerplate, feedback and (mainly) enormous patience. I specially thank Lucas Golino for the back-end implementation.

## Writing

All of the zines were written in a day or two — some took a day to drawn and another to write. Some of them were edited in InDesign, others were just xeroxed and passed forward. There are mixed themes and ideas, and I'd really love if you could go there and download them. If you could pay for them, though, that would be completely awesome.
