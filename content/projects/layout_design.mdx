I began working at Folha de S.Paulo as a layout designer. My main job was to plan photo, text and infographic location in a newspaper standard sized page. Using InDesign and proprietary software, I did that job for a good time and have a lot of stories to tell — like the one that I did the layout from concept to finish of the entire 40-something pages monday edition by myself.

Below, some of the pages I did at the time that I still like — even though I'd do them very much differently today.
