From the project's summary, published in English, Spanish and Portuguese:

> Evidence of global climate change is increasingly irrefutable, with the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
> Folha visited three continents to explore the impact of climate change on people's lives. The resulting nine-part series assesses the costs of adapting to a new reality — before it is too late.

The opening photo is the aerial view of overpopulated Gardi Sugdub, or Crab island, in the San Blas archipelago, Panama, from Lalo de Almeida/Folhapress. **This island will disappear** in the coming years because of global warming.

## Development details

First, this was 2018, and Folha de S.Paulo had _a lot_ of technical difficulties in implementing new technology, and we couldn't use _any_ database — **only static files**.

It's funny how now I know every keyword to explain what we built with sweat and blood at that time. Today I can say: we developed a **Static Site Generation** framework with **class-based React** that generated static HTML, CSS and JS **on build time**.

When the journalists needed to update the content, they'd use an **in-house system** that read and saved a Json that posed as a database — exported on a different server.

The user would get a **plain HTML** that would be **quickly revalidated** with any new content after loading the Json — having a very fast First Content Paint and, at the same time, updated information.

This was our own way to do what Next.JS and Gatsby did some time later — but **without the funding** and the tech community's hype.

We also heavily adapted New York Times' [AI2HTML](http://ai2html.org/) to generate **HTML5 responsive infographics** from Adobe Illustrator.
