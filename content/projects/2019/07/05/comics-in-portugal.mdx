I wrote the script of a few short comics for the Portuguese magazine H-alt. Below, a few words about them. All of the comics are in portuguese, except the first one.

## About Calaméo

The platform these comics are hosted does not have the best embed tool, so it's better to click the "arrow" button, then "read on Calaméo".

## Shots between Fangs

Shots Between Fangs was originally published in the portuguese magazine H-Alt. With only seven pages, it's violent and visceral, with geometric shapes and dark colors.

## Loteria

A short story about time travel and lottery. Originated after the concept that if someone had time travelling abilities, they'd win the lottery. What if the lottery was a government agency focused on arresting these travellers?
