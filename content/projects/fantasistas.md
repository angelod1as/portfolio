The main idea behind Fantastista's slides is the remaining position of the title. Along all slides it's kept in the same position, fixed after the first slide and kept with the 'f' over different images.

Each slide has a summary of the participants and their products.

At the end, a tent layout was suggested, with not only the physical items and positions but why those spaces were chosen to be that way.
