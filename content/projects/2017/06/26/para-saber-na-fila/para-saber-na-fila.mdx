_Para saber na fila_ (What to know while in line) was a one-minute video series made for TV Folha.

The project was based around small videos, posted on Instagram, that people could watch while in line for events or places of interest.

We did five episodes before TV Folha's leading team changed and the project was cancelled. All videos were directed by William Mur.

The first one was about a Picasso exposition.

The second, about SÃ£o Paulo's Ceagesp, a perfect place to buy plants.

The third, about a latin cinema expo, with a special room with Anna Muylaert's work.

The last (and my favourite), about Finding Nemo's sequel: Finding Dory.
