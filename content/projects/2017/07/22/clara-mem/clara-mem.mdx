I wrote a script for MIS's (Museum of Image and Sound) experimental cinema division alongside Daguito Rodrigues. The result was Clara.mem, a short film about memory, traumas and technology.

## About the film

In this short, Alberto (Igor Armucho) wakes up feeling a bit odd. He dresses-up, as usually, but when he crosses the door to leave his apartment, he is automatically taken back inside. As much as he tries to leave, he ends up by returning to the same place. His trials and errors make him realize he's trapped inside his own mind and memory.
