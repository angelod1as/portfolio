Videographer, musician, and editor Stefano Maccarini publishes an yearly zine with multiple artists about the year that just passed. I participated in many of his productions.

## Behind the Wheel (2017)

My participation in Dezessete (in English, "Seventeen") is a narrative about how my mother died in a car accident in 2007 and, 10 years later, my father and stepmother ended up having the same fate.

## Nice Calendar (2018)

In Dezoito (Eighteen), I drew two comics pages about one of my favourite projects: an inverted calendar.

Instead of writing about the appointments I'll have, I write about what have happened, who I met, and what I did.

## Mutual Hatred (2019)

My Dezenove (Nineteen) participation resulted in a very emotion and angst-ridden article about hate and how I deal with people that fuck up my friends.

## Twenty (2020)

This case was weird.

I wrote a comics script about the pandemics that would be illustrated by a friend of mine but... she never delivered the art.

So I published the raw script `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
