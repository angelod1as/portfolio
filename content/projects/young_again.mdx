Made in 2015, this song happened after a friend of old decided to go to different paths.

Made using Ableton Live. The vocals aren't so good, I can't sing and didn't pay attention to compression and other vocal effects.

## Lyrics

    We should part ways now
    This is not working the way we wanted
    We have different minds
    with different meanings
    and expectations

    Things weren't going well
    even if these things were my passion
    I really don't wan't you to be
    the projection of my frustration

    I wish we were young again

    we can be only friends
    and that's better than other choices
    We can meet sometimes
    and play, like children

    Let's not get serious
    Or it won't work
    Or we'll be right back
    to where we started
