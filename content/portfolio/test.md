## About the project

Evidence of global climate change is increasingly irrefutable, with the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Folha visited three continents to explore the impact of climate change on people’s lives. The resulting nine-part series assesses the costs of adapting to a new reality — before it is too late.
