These pages were built using the power of [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Gatsby**](https://gatsbyjs.org). The content is managed and hosted by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

You can see the public project [here](https://github.com/angelod1as/portfolio). Feel free to fork the repository.

Check the link above for the Gatsby's plugins I used to make this possible. I'm in love with Gatsby, even if working with images is *painful as hell*.
