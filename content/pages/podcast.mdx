# I'm angelo and I do **podcast**

I publish a (almost) **daily** podcast on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/cronofobia), free to listen an available on a **ton** of platforms (but, mainly, people end up listening on Spotify).

It's sadly only available in Brazilian Portuguese (for now. [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/oicronofobico) and ask for the English version). Even though, please click on Follow and leave 5 :star:

## Cover arts

### Third and current season

The current cover art is made by the comic book artist Silva João. I did a silent comic book with him, [Combo Breaker](/combo-breaker) (read for free).

The cover art for season 2 was done by great tattoo artist [Janaína Sirena](https://www.instagram.com/janainasirena).

### First season

I didn't have a proper cover art on my debut until the illustrator [RAVAEL (aka msrapoo)](https://www.instagram.com/msrapoo/) gave me one <3.
