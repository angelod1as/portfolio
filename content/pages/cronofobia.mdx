# I'm angelo and I do **Cronofobia**

I publish a (almost) **daily** podcast on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/cronofobia), free to listen an available on a **ton** of platforms (but, mainly, people end up listening on Spotify).

It's sadly only available in Brazilian Portuguese (for now. [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/oicronofobico) and ask for the English version). Even though, please click on Follow and leave 5 ‚≠ê

## Cover arts

### Third and current season

The current cover art is made by the comic book artist Silva Jo√£o. I did a silent comic book with him, [Combo Breaker](/combo-breaker) (read for free).
