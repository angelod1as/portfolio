## Time is short. Read this first.

Want to go straight to the important stuff? I've got you.

I'm a journalist, designer and developer, worked in award-winning publications at Folha de S.Paulo as a front-end developer and assisting in project management. I have substantial experience with displaying information in a concise and easy to understand way, using visual aids like videos, photos and data visualization.

My main technologies orbit around JavaScript — React, Node and, recently, Typescript. This website was built using Gatsby and I'm eager to learn NextJS.

I do want to learn other stuff, like Python, but I'd need a project to start learning. **I'm very good in learning by doing**.

## Projects

### A World of Walls

I was part of the team that developed A World of Walls, a multimedia project that shed light into the social problems around physical walls that divide countries or regions, like the one between West Bank and Israel, or the one that separates Lima, Peru, in two very different cities. It also has two chapters focusing on both sides of the Mexican/USA wall.

The website features extensive video documentaries for each chapter, as well as eye-catching photographic montages. In addition to that, infographics — in static and video format — make the data visible with maps and graphs.

A World of Walls won the following prizes:

- Petrobras Journalism award, the main prize of the category in Brazil
- King of Spain prize in digital journalism
- International Humanitarian Coverage prize from the Red Cross
- Grande Prêmio Folha 
- ÑH2017, the Spanish branch of Society of News Design.

### Datafolha - Brazil Elections

I was responsible for the data visualisation of Datafolha research during the 2018 elections. The research, held national-wide in Brazil, is one of the most important election indicators of the country.

My job was to show data through interactive graphs, easily updatable, responsive and lightweight.

### Choose the School

His latest project with Folha de S.Paulo was Choose the School, an interactive website in which the user can see data from 135 thousand Brazilian schools and their grades in several points — like how many students per class or the average of classes per day. The static data had to be parsed and cleaned, generating hundreds of JSON files, each one with a fraction of the information, resulting in a light and fast website.

The parsing script runs in Node.js and the website runs in React & Redux.

### Reservoir levels

I was also responsible for the redesign of the water reservoirs indicator in Folha de S.Paulo.
