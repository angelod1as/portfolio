*We understood — better late than never — that Capotes Marrons means something funny in French*

I absolutely love **Firefly**, the 2002 series about cowboys in space. So, to celebrate the series 18th birthday, I got three friends to record a podcast commenting each and every episode from the series — all fourteen of them.

The result is — in portuguese only — *Capotes Marrons*, a free translation of Browncoats.

The podcast is hosted on Anchor and can be listened in a lot of places, like Spotify.
