According to Merriam-Webster:

> **Stuff - noun**
>
> 1 - materials, supplies, or equipment used in various activities
>
> 2 - material to be manufactured, wrought, or used in construction
>
> 3 - a finished textile suitable for clothing
>
> 4 - **literary or artistic production; writing, discourse, talk, or ideas of little value**

Albeit disagreeing with the aforementioned *little value*, I always thought cool starting articles with dictionary citations.

## Stuff

I am a morning person — as opposed to my mostly nocturnal peers. This characteristic can be seen as simply uncommon or, when living with me and noticing my joyful smile at 6 am, as almost psychopatic.

My time (from ungodly early to late at night) is invested "making stuff".

*Stuff*.

One very singular example of *stuff* I do is my three-year-running satirical newspaper, Tempos Fantásticos. After thinking how to mix journalism, design and science-fiction, I designed, wrote and sold the newspapers' first edition. I did my best to unite passionate people and, after a few issues, I had a team of volunteers working alongside me. The publication improved a lot over three or four years.

Another of this *stuff* is... well, this website. I love to code and I'm eager to learn new technologies. Beyond paid work, like quizzes, data-driven search tools and storytelling platforms, I'm excited to take part in new digital projects. Some of them *stuff* I'm working on are still *very* secret.

*Stuff* is what makes my heart beat and what keeps my cogs in motion. I'm equipped and skilled to do a lot of *stuff*. While in Journalism school, one of my teachers said:

> "You should become multimedia professionals: not only writers, but video editors, moviemakers, programmers and, when possible, all of that combined"

As it seems, I kept that advice as a promise to myself.

## Renaissance man

Obviously I woudn't be an idiot and call myself a "renaissance man" (nor put the term as a subtitle of one of my articles). Apart from that, the term describes my abilities very well. I can do a *shitload* of *stuff* and even like to be a (god forbid!) generalist.

You read it right. I'm a generalist and kinda proud of it.

I can:

- build websites from the ground;
- write endless lines of code;
- write endless pages of fiction;
- design for print and digital;
- manage project(s);
- cook a killer cheese quiche;
- try to be funny when I should be serious.

Whoa, that's a big list... and that doesn't even scrach the surface of what I do.

If you read this far, I recommend clicking [here](/) and going back to the main page. There you can explore more *stuff* I do and even know me better, like, knowing what I do when I'm not working — mostly *never*.

## I'd like to work:

- Mixing design, coding and journalism;
- Remotely;
- Abroad — I'm from Brazil;
- As an alternative model (one can dream);
- As a fulltime fiction writer (one can dream, *right*?).

# Resume

If you want a *boring* PDF resume, you can download it [here (in English)](https://angelodias.com.br/assets/docs/angelo-en.pdf) and here [(in Brazilian Portuguese)](https://angelodias.com.br/assets/docs/angelo-ptbr.pdf), but I guarantee this website is *way better*.
