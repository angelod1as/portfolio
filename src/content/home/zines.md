<!-- TODO lacking images -->

While working on many projects, I found myself in need of artistic expression without traditional boundaries. As I'm not so good with this "zero boundaries" thing, I created his own.

<!-- excerpt -->

My zines talk about... anything. I have one about his first date with a girl, another one about death and a small one about some translated ancient chinese script — obviously false.

The chosen format was two A4 papers folded and stapled — A5 result. After meeting Márcio Sno, I started doing minizines — A7 sized, 16 pages. Printed at home or at the cheap xerox place, my zines express thoughts and ideas that *could* be better expressed... but lack the time and money needed.

I plan to make a 12 issue collections — inspired by [Aline Valek](https://alinevalek.com.br/) — but couldn't find the time yet. On a second thought, I should do a zine about not finding time. Nice.
