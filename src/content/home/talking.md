Talking in front of people (or cameras) was always a part of my life and I hone this skill whenever I can.

<!-- excerpt -->

I used to teach english, at 18, to people from 12 to 60 (yes) years old. At college, I loved to do presentations and videos.

According to Lucas Dias, lawyer, businessman and *my brother*:

> Angelo talks too much.

He's dead right. I always dreamed about reaching people and making *stuff* using my voice and way-to-excited gestures.

One of the reasons I've been the *face* of many projects is my ease to deal with cameras and crowds. I gave niche-specific talks (like NaNoWriMo pep talk), short reporting for Folha de S.Paulo and I am planning a course about non-conventional narratives.

I can talk in english and portuguese, standing or seated, always energetic and compromised in making people understand my topics and feel interested.

## I'd love to

- Make videos
- Do presentations and lectures
- Do hands-on workshops
- Teach, like, anything I know

Let's do something together? Hit me at [oiangelodias\[at\]gmail.com](mailto:oiangelodias@gmail.com) and let's... well, talk.
