Five years at Folha de S.Paulo (Latin America's biggest newspaper) taught me a lot about organizing content in limited spaces, being those the margins of a page or the kb limit of a file.

I don't just 'know softwares'. **I'm a professional layout designer**.

## Work

Before moving to coding, I built *a lot* of pages at Folha de S.Paulo. You can see my (very amateur) beginner work [here](/http://be.net/angelod1as). They are a few years old, before Folha's new design project, but shows that I already knew what I wanted to work with: **sharp colors**, **whitespace** and **contrast**.

After moving my focus to coding, I kept those keywords in mind. As I didn't want to lose what this growing passion, I did what I could to keep designing [*stuff*](/stuff).

My current layout design job is [Tempos Fant√°sticos](/newspaper). Using Adobe InDesign, I plan and executes each issue, with fixed and moving parts, variable article lenghts and multiple illustration direction.

I also do smaller jobs, like folders and [slides](/). Actually, he does whatever I identify with, being that a large project for a mega company or a small hobby project with friends.

Design is something I'll never stop loving, no matter where the world takes me.
