# Angelo Dias's portfolio.

The [website](https://angelodias.com.br) is self explanatory. There's not really need for a README.

There's even a [colophon](https://www.angelodias.com.br/about/#colophon).

Made using JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Netlify, VS Code, and more. See [here](https://www.angelodias.com.br/about/#colophon).

## Like what you see?

Then pleeeease hire me!

(That's the whole point of the portfolio).

JS, React, Redux, and more. Hit me on [oiangelodias\[at\]gmail.com](mailto:oiangelodias@gmail.com).

(I prefer remote jobs and short to medium length projects, but will happily consider any offer)

## I want to clone this repo!

Nice, you can do it. Just PLEASE let me know. It took a while to figure out this design and I really like it.

Clone, `yarn` then `yarn develop` (or `gatsby develop` if you have `gatsby-cli`.)
