## I'm a proud generalist

My main focus is communication.

I can integrate a multidisciplinary team and work out the individuality of each member in order to deliver greater value to the customer and to the professionals.

I actually like being in meetings and organizing things. I'm a certified Scrum Master but adapt well to different Agile environments

Also, I code using Typescript and React.
