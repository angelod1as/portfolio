## I want

... to work with developers, designers, product owners, technical and non-technical people, making sure the work is fun and important;

... to be a hub of information to anyone, from any department. A go-to place to solve problems and to understand the big-picture;

... to be on the meetings no one wants to be, in order for them to use their time in an intelligent way: doing what they do best;

... to deliver high value in whatever format the client needs. My focus is web development, but this can change at any time. [Read my carreer manifesto](/carreer).
